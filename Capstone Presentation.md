## Creating a Predictive Text App
### June 14 2020


Project Description
========================================================

This project is part of the Data Science Specialization Course 
offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. Additionally,
this project is done in collaboration with Swiftkey, a company that specializes in predictive text modeling.

The goal of this project was to use text analysis and 
natural language processing to create a predictive text 
model that can be accessed through an app hosted on Shiny.


Model Description
========================================================

The predictive text model was created using a Kat's back-off model.

I also consulted the following resources:

[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30tbKxLASn4) to create my text prediction model

Shiny App
========================================================

The Shiny app can be found [here](http://jramil.shinyapps.io/Capstone_App/).

The Shiny app has a simple interface. To use it, one simply
needs to enter the beginning of a sentence 
(e.g. *I like to listen to the*).

Then the user can click on the *Predict Text* button to generate 
the predicted text.

Additional Information
========================================================

The full code used for this project (including this presentation)
can be found [here](http://github.com/joanneramil/DataScienceCapstone).

I would like to end by thanking the instructors of the course. 
I gained new skills and knowledge that will be very useful in the future.

**Good luck to everyone on your data science journey!**
